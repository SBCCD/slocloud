It appears that students were able to successfully use their compasses and their surroundings to navigate their way around an unknown area, manage time and return successfully to their point of origin.  Their mapping skills were pretty accurate based on the few tools they had available to them.  Although they were not all expert map makers they were all aware of the directions they were traveling and had a good understanding of time and space.
2.   All students were able to increase the distance they traveled in a one hour period on the same trail.  This was due to an increase in their personal walking pace.  This may have been altered due to an increase in cardio respiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance or walking mechanics.  Some of the students who only scored a 3 may have been capable of more however, quite a few of them hung out in groups or with partners which may have slowed their pace.

3.   Students did an excellent job of preparing their packs each day.  The students who received a 3 did so because they did not bring a snack or did not have enough water.  Many of them simply forgot to recharge their packs after our longer weekend hikes.  Money is also a factor for some of these students.
 
This class has performed better than previous hiking classes and it really appears to be due to good daily attendance and uniform participation in longer off campus hikes.

13,"2014-12-16 09:51:23",2014FA,MATH,MATH-266,MATH-266-40,"Notes: For the first SLO, the majority of the students were able to identify the type of differential equation and implement an appropriate method to solve it. Some made minor mistakes in the computational part. For the second SLO, the majority of the students were able to apply reasoning to solve a word problem of a real-life situation. The majority of the students were able to analyze the word problem, set up the appropriate differential equation, and solve the problem. There were very few mistakes.
Overall, the results are very positive. I think the target was met because only 26 students out of the 28 were evaluated in the SLOs, two students stopped showing up to class after the drop date and were not evaluated in the SLOs. If the base number for the SLOs is 26 and not 28, the percentages would be 84.6% and 88.5%, which in my opinion are very good result.
